MotleyFool,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/why-costco-beats-out-its-competition-12097171,Why Costco Beats Out Its Competition,"Costco Wholesale has been a reliable stock for years. The company consistently demonstrates sales and earnings growth, and its differentiated business model breeds loyalty and generates volume.Even though it's different from a typical retailer, it's not the only player with this model. But it performs better than its peers. Let's see why, and what that means for its stock.Costco has had an impressive run over the past two years, and higher-than-usual growth is finally beginning to slow down. But that changes nothing about the business model, along with the value that Costco offers, which makes it such a compelling stock to own.",2d
MotleyFool,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/down-20percent-in-2022--is-costco-stock-a-buy-right-now-12091985,"Down 20% In 2022, Is Costco Stock a Buy Right Now?","Last year was a difficult one for stock market investors, to say the least. Not only did the riskiest and most speculative companies see their share prices plummet, but even the most dominant, successful, and competitively advantaged enterprises experienced falling stock prices. Tightening monetary policy and a general risk aversion by investors negatively affected businesses of all shapes and sizes.Even Costco Wholesale wasn't immune from the despair. This top retail stock ended 2022 down 20%. Does that mean it's a smart buy right now? Let's take a closer look.As consumers flocked to its popular warehouses during the depths of the pandemic, Costco flourished. Sales jumped 17.5% in fiscal 2021 and 15.8% in fiscal 2022 (ended Aug. 28), exceeding historical averages. In fact, year-over-year revenue growth was above 12% in nine straight quarters from the fourth quarter of 2020 through Q4 2022.",3d
MotleyFool,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/better-buy--costco-vs--nike-12090606,Better Buy: Costco vs. Nike,"Costco Wholesale and Nike(NYSE: NKE) are two consumer goods heavyweights that have delivered incredible shareholder wealth over many years. They both have extraordinary brand power and generate high consumer loyalty. If you're looking to invest in a top blue-chip stock, which one of these is the better buy today? Let's take a look.Costco has had an impressive run over the past two years, and its higher-than-usual growth is finally beginning to slow down. But that changes nothing about the inherent business model and value that Costco offers, which is what makes it such a compelling candidate as a stock to own.Costco is the leader in warehouse-style superstores but only third in U.S. retail according to sales, behind the two largest companies in the U.S., Walmart and Amazon. Costco's formula is simple but powerful: offer the lowest prices through the lowest markups, achieve consumer loyalty, and generate massive sales volume.",4d

InvestorPlace,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/the-7-best-dividend-stocks-to-buy-to-beat-the-market-1032029278,The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy to Beat the Market,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn any market condition, it’s important to hold dividend stocks in one’s portfolio. These stocks provide regular cash inflow and, if valuations are attractive, meaningful capital gains. With market conditions remaining relatively bearish, some of the best dividend stocks trade at attractive valuations. These stocks can potentially deliver robust total returns.I also want to point out that the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEARCA:VYM) has delivered annualized returns of 11.6% in the last 10 years. During the same period, the Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:VUG) has delivered annualized returns of 12.8%.It therefore makes sense to hold low-beta dividend stocks in the portfolio. This is particularly true at a time when macroeconomic headwinds are significant.I also believe that the discussed dividend stocks are likely to outperform the index returns in 2023. Let’s talk about the reasons for considering these best dividend stocks.Newmont Corporation (NEM)Source: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockGold has been trending higher as inflation data indicates that this might be the end of aggressive contractionary policies. With the possibility of a recession in 2023, gold is an attractive investment theme.Among gold miners, Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) stock is worth considering at current levels. The 4.19% dividend yield has the potential to deliver capital gains besides visibility for dividend growth.An investment-grade balance sheet and robust cash flows are key reasons to like Newmont. Additionally, the company has a strong asset base with 96 million ounces of proved reserves. This provides stable production visibility.High financial flexibility is also likely to ensure that the reserve replacement is close to 100%. Additionally, Newmont expects its all-in-sustaining cost to decline in the next few years. As gold trends higher, there is significant room for EBITDA margin expansion.Lockheed Martin (LMT)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is also among the best dividend stocks to buy. The stock, which sports a 2.68% dividend yield, trades at an attractive price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 16.6. I expect the stock to remain in an uptrend besides the benefit of quarterly cash dividends.Defense-sector spending will likely remain high in the coming years. Lockheed Martin is positioned to benefit as contracts increase from the U.S. and European countries. As of Q3 2022, Lockheed Martin reported an order backlog of $140 billion.This provides clear cash-flow visibility. For the first nine months of 2022, the company reported free cash flow (FCF) of $4.9 billion. With the order intake remaining robust, LMT stock is also among the top dividend growth stocks.When it comes to long-term growth, Lockheed Martin is investing in new technology. This includes hypersonics, directed energy and autonomy. Investment in innovation will ensure that Lockheed remains among the top defense players.AT&T (T)Source: Lester Balajadia / Shutterstock.comAT&T (NYSE:T) is attractive for two reasons. First, the stock offers a dividend yield of 5.74% that seems sustainable. Further, T stock trades at a forward P/E ratio of 7.5. A meaningful rally is likely from undervalued levels.The media division spinoff has allowed AT&T to focus on its core business. Importantly, the company has reduced net debt by $25 billion year to date through Q3 2022. With the company expecting $14 billion in free cash flow for the year, deleveraging will continue.The business metrics also look encouraging for AT&T. The company continues to add 5G wireless and fiber subscribers. Increased 5G penetration is likely to translate into higher average revenue per user. For Q3 2022, AT&T reported the best revenue growth in wireless services in more than a decade.I must also mention that the company reported capital expenditure of $5.9 billion for Q3 2022. With an annual investment visibility of $20 billion, revenue growth is likely to be supported in the coming years.Pfizer (PFE)Source: photobyphm / Shutterstock.comPfizer’s (NYSE:PFE) stock has been in a correction mode, and the key reason is lower revenue visibility from the Covid-19 vaccine. However, at a forward P/E ratio of 9.8, the stock seems seriously undervalued. PFE stock also offers an attractive dividend yield of 3.56%.If we look beyond near-term concerns, there are several reasons to like Pfizer. The company has a product pipeline of 112 drugs, and as these candidates are commercialized, revenue growth is likely.Further, Pfizer has boosted its financial flexibility with significant free cash flows from vaccine sales. This cash is being deployed to accelerate the product pipeline.At the same time, Pfizer has been active on the inorganic growth front. The company is targeting $25 billion in risk-adjusted revenue from new business deals by 2030.Recently, Pfizer announced that it will sell its full portfolio of drugs to low-income countries at no profit. The company establishing a presence in these markets could be potentially rewarding in the long term.Rio Tinto (RIO)Source: Rob Bayer / Shutterstock.comAmong industrial commodity dividend stocks, Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) is worth buying. The 8.95% dividend yield stock has trended higher by 35% in the last six months. However, the stock still trades at an attractive forward P/E ratio of 11.39.Rio Tinto reported free cash flow of $7.1 billion for the first half of 2022. With an annualized FCF potential of $14 billion, the business is a cash-flow machine. This has translated into a quality balance sheet that ensures sustained dividends.It’s worth noting that Rio has guided for annual capital expenditure of $9.5 billion for 2023 and 2024. This excludes any potential mergers and acquisitions. With Rio focused on base metals like copper and lithium, the outlook is positive. These metals will remain in demand with a continued push toward green energy. As an example, Rio is already positioned to be the largest supplier of lithium in Europe in the next 15 years.Chevron Corporation (CVX)Source: Trong Nguyen / Shutterstock.comChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is possibly among the best dividend stocks for the long term. Chevron was among the few companies that managed to generate positive operating cash flows (OCFs) when oil plunged in 2021. With low breakeven assets, the company is positioned to deliver robust cash flows.Just to put things into perspective, Chevron reported operating cash flow of $13.7 billion for Q3 2022. On an annual basis, the OCF potential is in excess of $40 billion. The company has ambitious plans to invest $15 billion to $17 billion annually in the next few years.Even after these investments, there is ample cash flow for dividend growth and share repurchases. Furthermore, Chevron reported a net-debt ratio of 4.9% as of Q3 2022. Strong financial flexibility allows Chevron to make significant investments in the lower carbon business.Chevron also has a strong asset base, and the reserve replacement has been healthy. This ensures long-term cash-flow visibility and shareholder value creation.Costco Wholesale (COST)Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.comRetail stocks have been depressed in 2022, with inflation playing the spoilsport. However, amid the challenges, Costco(NASDAQ:COST) has traded sideways in the last 12 months. A dividend yield of 0.75% might not sound attractive. However, I expect COST stock to trend higher, and there is dividend growth visibility.For the first quarter of 2023, Costco reported revenue growth of 8.1% to $53.44 billion. The key point to note is that the U.S. is staring at a potential recession. With retail spending being a key growth driver, policies are likely to be directed toward boosting spending. This will benefit Costco.It’s worth noting that Costco has 66.9 million household members. This translates into $4.3 billion in annualized membership fees. With continued expansion and high renewal rates, I expect the recurring revenue to swell. This will have a positive impact on free cash flows.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

InvestorPlace,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/the-top-7-millionaire-maker-long-term-stocks-for-2023-1032028946,The Top 7 “Millionaire-Maker” Long-Term Stocks for 2023,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsStudy after study shows that a long-term buy-and-hold investing strategy works best. Along-term investmentis generally defined as any position in a stock that is held for a year or longer. While the stock market can decline by 20% or more in a single year, which was the case in 2022, equities almost always rise over the long term. For example, the U.S. stock market has posted an average annual return of 8% or more during 20-year periods. Over 30 years, the average annual return is closer to 9%, for a total return of 1,300%. The math is clear. The longer one stays invested, thebetter their returnsare likely to be.However, staying invested through market downturns, economic shocks, global recessions, and wars can be difficult. As humans, we are prone to getting nervous and frightened, and that can lead to us hitting the “sell” button too early, costing us dearly in the long run. Remaining calm and being patient are often the most important attributes of an investor. Here are the top seven “millionaire-maker” long-term stocks to buy for 2023.TickerCompanyPriceAAPLApple$135.21NVDANvidia$173.77AMZNAmazon$95.46BRK-A, BRK-BBerkshire Hathaway$466,259.97, $308.30DXCMDexcom$106.63GOOG, GOOGLAlphabet$91.78, $91.12COSTCostco$479.47Apple (AAPL)Source: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.comFew stocks have returned as much value to shareholders as consumer electronics giantApple(NASDAQ:AAPL). The Silicon Valley company’s share price has gained 202% in the last five years, 625% in the past decade, and 79,000% since its initial public offering (IPO) in 1983. Long-term, it is difficult to find a stock that has performed better than Apple. And the good news for investors is that Apple is currently on sale, havingdeclined 21%over the last 12 months to currently trade at $134 a share.Many of the world’s most successful investors have made Apple a core position in their portfolio, including Warren Buffett, the most successful investor of all time. Buffett’s holding company,Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B), currently owns $123.34 billion worth of Apple stock, making it thebiggest position in the portfolio. Buffett himself has beenbuying AAPL stockover the last year as the price has slumped.With continued new product innovations, including rumors of atouchscreen Mac computerandvirtual reality headset, Apple looks set to outperform for many years to come.Nvidia (NVDA)Source: ShutterstockChipmakerNvidia(NASDAQ:NVDA) has been battered and bruised in the last year. The Santa Clara, California-based company’s stock price has fallen 35% over the last 12 months, which is close to the drop in the Nasdaq index over the same time period. However, NVDA stock remains up nearly 200% in the last five years and has gained 5,350% over the last 10 years. Aslong-term investmentsgo, Nvidia has been a winner for its shareholders.There is every reason to believe that Nvidia will continue its outperformance. The company’s microchips and semiconductors are at the cutting edge of technological innovations that include artificial intelligence and self-driving cars. And its products continue todominate in the video game space. With supply chain bottlenecks and demand recovering, there are signs that NVDA stock may have bottomed in recent weeks. So far into 2023, the share price has increased by 18% to now trade at just under $170 a share.Amazon (AMZN)Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comDon’t count out e-commerce giantAmazon(NASDAQ:AMZN) either as a going concern or an investment. The Seattle-based company has produced long-term gains for investors that few other stocks can match. AMZN stock had climbed higher by nearly 600% in the last 10 years and is up nearly 110,000% since its 1997 IPO when it began trading for less than $1 a share. While the share price has beenknocked lower by nearly 40%in the last 12 months, indications point to short-term issues that shouldn’t weigh down the stock over the long term.Specifically, Amazon overbuilt, over-hired, and over-extended itself during the pandemic when the world was isolated at home and forced to shop online. The company is now working to course correct,laying off nearly 20,000 staff, closing fulfillment centers around the world, and delaying the launch of several projects. If chief executive Andy Jassy and his team can right the ship, there is every reason to believe that AMZN stock will continue growing into the future.Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comWe mentioned that Apple is Warren Buffett’s most widely held position and that AAPL stock has delivered huge gains to Berkshire Hathaway. However, Berkshire itself is no slouch as an investment. In fact, the stock has been a juggernaut for long-term buy-and-hold investors for decades. Berkshire Hathaway’s Class A stock hasdoubled twice in the past decade. Since 1990, the stock has grown more than eight million percent.That kind of growth is mind-boggling. So too, is the current $480,000 share price of the Class A stock, which has never split. The Class A shares have gotten so hefty that stock exchanges have had to be reconfigured to enable them to continue trading on their bourse.Berkshire’s Class B stock, which trades at a ratio of 1/1,500th of the Class A stock, is more reasonably priced at $317 per share currently. Any way you slice it, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has proven to be astupendous long-term investment.Dexcom (DXCM)Source: FOOTAGE VECTOR PHOTO / Shutterstock.comProbably the least well-known stock on this list isDexcom(NASDAQ:DXCM). The San Diego-based medical device company makes continuous glucose monitoring systems for people who have Diabetes. And its glucose monitoring systems have become the standard in the U.S. and many other countries around the world. This has led to big gains in DXCM stock over the long term. Consider that the company’s share price hasincreased 675%in the last five years and gained more than 2,800% over the past 10 years. Since going public in 2005, the stock has been up more than 4,000%.The current share price of $108 looks expensive, with a price-earnings ratio of more than 200. However, analysts remain bullish on DXCM stock, with a median price target on the shares of $130, suggesting a further 20% upside from current levels. Dexcom continues to benefit from its focus on treating Diabetes and its market-leading position when it comes to innovative glucose monitoring systems. The company continues to bring new Diabetes management products to market and is forecasting that it willgrow 32.9%in each of the next five years. This is a stock built for the long term.Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Source: Benny Marty / Shutterstock.comAny investor who got in onAlphabet’s(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) IPO nearly 20 years ago is sitting pretty today. That’s because GOOGL stock has risen more than 3,250% since the tech giant made its market debut in August 2004. More recently, the share price has gained 60% in the past five years. In the last 12 months, Alphabet has undertaken a 20-for-1 stock split that has made theshares much more affordable. A 33% decline in the share price has also helped make the stock cheap at its current level of $91. The price-earnings ratio of 18 is the lowest it has been in more than a decade.Investors looking for a best-in-class tech company should give serious consideration to buying GOOGL stock while it’s on sale. With the online advertising market recovering and the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes nearing their conclusion, theoutlook for Alphabetand its share price is brightening. Plus, Alphabet continues to grow its market share in sectors ranging from smartphones and artificial intelligence to cloud computing and wearable tech. The company’s balance sheet is fortified for an economic downturn, and Alphabet continues to generate huge amounts of cash, primarily from digital advertisements. This is a stock built for the long term.Costco (COST)Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.comBig box retailerCostco’s(NASDAQ:COST) stock seems tooutperform in any type of market. COST stock has been flat over the last year, up 153% in the last five years, and has gained nearly 400% during the past decade. Since the year 2000, the Seattle-based company’s share price has risen 1,000%. This is a testament to Costco’s strong business model, durable competitive advantage, and the near cult-like devotion of its customers who pay an annual membership fee to shop at the warehouse club.Costco’s same-store sales growth has remained consistently strong throughout the pandemic and economic reopening; the company is expanding into new service areas that include travel, home improvement, and business services, and itsmembership renewal rate is above 95%, the industry gold standard. Costco’s net sales in its most recent fiscal year, which ended October 2022, totaled $222.7 billion, up 16% from the previous year and an all-time record for the company. No wonder Yahoo Finance named Costco its 2022 “Company of the Year.” Investors with a long time horizon should definitely consider a position in COST stock.On the date of publication, Joel Bagloleheld long positions in AAPL, NVDA and GOOGL.

Given the recent strong performance, many investors are trying to figure out what's next for Costco.The start of a new year is a good time for shareholders to reassess why they like this business. Let's take a closer look at both sides of the investment argument for this top retail stock.A top reason to like Costco as an investor involves the resilience of the business model. During the Great Recession more than a decade ago, the company's net sales declined by only 1.5% in fiscal 2009, its only down revenue year in at least the past 21 fiscal years. What's more, Costco really shined during the coronavirus pandemic, with annual revenue growth exceeding 15% in the past two fiscal years.Customers turn to Costco and its 847 warehouses to find the lowest prices around on a range of product categories, all in a no-frills environment. And this relentless focus on value will never go out of style.",7d

InvestorPlace,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/the-7-most-undervalued-stocks-to-buy-for-2023-1032032481,The 7 Most Undervalued Stocks to Buy for 2023,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs the market continues to struggle, it’s a great time to look for undervalued stocks to buy.There are bargains to be found in the stock market for investors who have nerves of steel and can stomach the ongoing volatility. The ups and downs of the stock market over the last year has resulted in some of the best-run companies in the U.S. having undervalued stocks. These securities are trading at a huge discount relative to their current and future earnings, creating buying opportunities for investors looking to put capital to work in a weak market.These names should pay off handsomely over the long term. Here are seven of the most undervalued stocks to buy for 2023.WSMWilliams-Sonoma$123.70WWWWolverine Worldwide$13.53HOGHarley-Davidson$43.19HRBH&R Block$37.44KRKroger$44.45SWKStanley Black & Decker$85.83Williams-Sonoma (WSM)Source: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.comKitchenware and home furnishing company Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) might not be on most investors’ radars, but it should be. The San Francisco-based concern’s stock has pulled back 13% in the last 12 months to $123 a share. The price-earnings ratio of WSM stock is currently 7.30, which is about half that of the S&P 500. And the shares pay a quarterly dividend of 78 cents a share, resulting in a yield of 2.50%.Other reasons to consider adding Williams-Sonoma to your portfolio include the fact that the company has no debt, a strong online and social media presence ( it has 1.6 million followers on Instagram), and a net income margin of 13.5%. Also noteworthy is that WSM has increased its earnings per share (EPS) at an average clip of 50% over the last three years. Finally, Williams-Sonoma’s 22% revenue growth in 2021 was more than triple the 7% average growth rate of the U.S. furniture industry.Add in $2.5 billion of stock buybacks in the past five years, and WSM stock looks like a no-brainer. Investors should buy the dip of this undervalued stock.Wolverine World Wide (WWW)Source: It for you / Shutterstock.comInvestors might not be familiar with Wolverine World Wide (NYSE:WWW), but they certainly know its products. The Michigan-based footwear company makes some of the most popular sneakers and shoes in the world. Its portfolio of brands includes Hush Puppies, Merrell, Keds, Saucony and Top Sider, to name only a few. Wolverine also has agreements in place to make footwear for other companies such as Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT).Wolverine thrived before the Covid-19 pandemic. In February 2020, WWW stock was trading above $30 a share. However, retail store closures during the pandemic hurt its business, and it has struggled to overcome excess inventories as the economy has reopened, leading it to implement discounts and markdowns.Consequently, Wolverine’s stock has declined 47% over the last year, and the stock’s low price-earnings ratio of 6.86 indicates that it is undervalued at its current levels.Despite its woes, WWW stock pays a quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share, which equates to a significant yield of 3%. Look for this stock to rebound once WWW’s inventories are adjusted and inflation continues to ease.Harley-Davidson (HOG)Source: Alex Erofeenkov / Shutterstock.comMotorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) is a legendary company not just in the U.S. but all over the world. A going concern since 1903, Harley-Davidson continues to make some of the most popular, in-demand motorcycles. And while its stock has been on an upswing over the past six months, its long-term performance has lagged the market. In the past 12 months, HOG stock has gained 29%, which is great. But over the last five years, the stock is down 22%.Harley-Davidson’s current P/E ratio of nine is also low and shows the stock is a bargain at its current levels. HOG also pays a quarterly dividend of 16 cents a share, giving the stock a yield of 1.45%The reasons for the shares’ long-term underperformance are many. The company’s efforts to expand its brand into other areas of the motorcycle ecosystem such as apparel, accessories, and lifestyle products have had mixed results. And some investors have been concerned about the costs and uncertainty associated with Harley Davidson’s plans to pivot to electric motorcycles.Still, the strong brand awareness and popularity of its motorcycles make HOG stock an undervalued stocks to buy for 2023.H&R Block (HRB)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comTax season is fast approaching, making it a good time to consider H&R Block (NYSE:HRB). The Kansas City-based tax preparation company had a spectacular 2022, with its share price gaining 75% in a down market.But even with that monster growth, HRB stock still looks undervalued . The stock’s P/E ratio is only 11.83 despite the big advance, and the median price target on the stock is $48.Moving forward, HRB stock is likely to continue benefitting from the company’s strong earnings growth. Analysts, on average, expect the firm’s EPS to increase at a mean rate of 12.5%. Analysts’ mean estimates calls for its earnings in 2023 and 2024 to grow 8.3% and 9.8%, respectively. And H&R Block continues to execute on its five-year strategic plan, called “Block Horizons,” that focuses on building stronger relationships with small businesses and expanding its suite of digital tax tools.HRB stock also has a dividend yield of 3.1%. And, given the nature of its business, investors can have confidence in H&R Block’s record keeping.Kroger (KR)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAs the largest supermarket operator and fifth largest retailer in the U.S., Cincinnati-based Kroger (NYSE:KR) should get more attention from the investing community, especially given its relatively cheap valuation. At Friday’s closing share price of $44.39, KR stock is trading 35% below its 52-week high of $62.78. The P/E ratio of 13.9 is slightly below the S&P 500 mean of 16 and far below the ratio of competitors such as Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).Kroger’s diminished valuation is due almost entirely to uncertainty surrounding its proposed $24.6 billion merger with its rival supermarket chain ,Albertsons (NYSE:ACI), a deal that will solidify Kroger as the biggest supermarket chain in America by revenue.However, while the merger still needs regulatory approval, it remains on track to close in 2024. But even without the deal, Kroger remains a solid long-term stock to own. It also has a dividend yield of 2.34%.Stanley Black & Decker (SWK)Source: ricochet64 / Shutterstock.comTool and hardware giant Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE:SWK) has seen better days. The Connecticut-based company’s share price has slumped 51% in the last 12 months, pulling its P/E ratio down to 9.4. Over the past five years, SWK stock has decreased 50%.The prolonged slump is the result of cost pressures due to international trade tariffs, unfavorable foreign exchange rates, and increased commodity prices, all of which were an issue for the company before the pandemic. Bloated inventories have also been a problem.However, Stanley Black & Decker is making moves that will turn its business around. These include cutting costs by $2 billion over the next three years, with $1 billion of the cost reductions slated to take place in 2023. Stanley Black & Decker also plans to reduce the number of products it sells, utilize fewer suppliers, and revamp its supply chain. Last year, the company sold its electronic security and automatic doors businesses to help refocus on its hammers and drills.If the turnaround succeeds, investors can expect the stock to rally. Worth noting is that SWK stock has a dividend yield 0f 3.75% at present.Goodyear Rubber & Tire (GT)Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.comFew stocks look as undervalued as Goodyear Rubber & Tire (NASDAQ:GT). GT stock has fallen nearly 50% in the last year, and its P/E ratio currently sits at 3.8. Over the past five years, the company’s share price has plunged nearly 70%. This is a truly dreadful performance for a company that is a household name in the U.S.The Ohio-based company that has been in business since 1898 had struggled with rising competition and slowing sales for years before the Covid-19 pandemic. But in 2022, higher raw materials prices and the negative impacts of a strong U.S. dollar caused the share price to crater.Management is trying to evolve. At this year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES), Goodyear unveiled a new tire that contains 90% sustainable materials.The company has let it be known that, after more than a century, it is trying to lessen its reliance on rubber. Time will tell if the shift works. But some analysts are starting to warm to GT stock. Keybanc Capital Markets, for example, recently placed an “overweight” rating and a $39 price target on the stock.On the date of publication, Joel Bagloleheld a long position in KR.

MotleyFool,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/better-buy--starbucks-vs--costco-12080493,Better Buy: Starbucks vs. Costco,"Starbucks and Costco Wholesale both withstood the S&P 500's 14% decline over the past 12 months. Starbucks' stock rose 7%, while Costco experienced a mild decline of 4%. Let's see why these two S&P 500 companies outperformed so many of their peers -- and if one is a more promising investment right now.At first glance, Starbucks might seem like a risky investment. The coffee chain is heavily exposed to inflation, which drives up its costs and curbs the market's appetite for its pricey beverages. And the COVID-19 lockdowns in China affected its second-largest market after the United States.Starbucks also faces unionization demands in the U.S., while founder Howard Schultz -- who returned as its interim CEO last year -- is in the process of handing the reins to its new CEO, Laxman Narasimhan.",8d

Shares declined by less than the market did in 2022 even though the retailer's business could be hurt by a recession. Sales growth was already slowing heading into the core holiday shopping period.But there is a lot more to a Costco investment than simply judging the company as an everyday retailer. Let's look at three big factors that might not be obvious at a glance, but that make the company an attractive choice for smart investors.Costco's valuation doesn't make sense if you compare it to traditional retailers. Target (NYSE: TGT) stock is going for 0.7 times annual earnings right now compared to Costco's 0.9 times. The company even looks expensive compared to more successful retailers like Kroger (NYSE: KR), with its P/S ratio of 0.2.",8d

Zacks,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/costco-wholesale-corporation-cost-is-a-trending-stock--facts-to-know-before-betting-on-it-12076495,Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,"Costco (COST) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this warehouse club operator have returned +5.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry, which Costco falls in, has gained 5.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Costco is expected to post earnings of $3.21 per share, indicating a change of +9.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $14.28 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +8.7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $15.63 indicates a change of +9.5% from what Costco is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Costco.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Costco, the consensus sales estimate of $55.56 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +7.1%. The $243.22 billion and $257.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +7.2% and +5.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCostco reported revenues of $54.44 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.1%. EPS of $3.10 for the same period compares with $2.97 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $54.67 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.42%. The EPS surprise was -1.27%.Over the last four quarters, Costco surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Costco is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click hereto see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Costco. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.This Little-Known Semiconductor Stock Could Be Your Portfolio’s Hedge Against InflationEveryone uses semiconductors.

Target Stock,"Costco Wholesale and Target (NYSE: TGT) are two of the best-known retailers in the U.S. And while both companies are popular for offering a variety of goods at low prices, Costco relies on a lower operating margin and higher volumes, while Target usually has a higher operating margin because it sells a larger mix of discretionary products.Therefore, it's no surprise that Target has been hit harder than Costco by supply chain disruptions and inflation.

However, with geopolitical, macroeconomic, and technological changes, a part of the portfolio needs to be dynamic. At the same time, there are stocks to buy and hold forever.These stocks represent companies that have a strong balance sheet and robust cash flows. Further, these companies have remained ahead of the curve when it comes to changes and innovation. The result is sustained value creation through dividends and capital gains.It’s also worth mentioning that most of these stocks to buy and hold is low-beta stocks. Amidst market volatility, these stocks offer protection from capital erosion. I would personally allocate at least 40% to 50% of my portfolio toward these stocks. I can also say with some conviction that total returns (dividend and capital gains) from these stocks over the next five to ten years will outperform the index.Let’s discuss the reasons to be bullish on these stocks to buy and hold forever.TickerCompanyPriceCVXChevron Corporation$177.56LMTLockheed Martin$449.83COSTCostco Wholesale$485.25RIORio Tinto$77.55AAPLApple$134.76NEMNewmont Corporation$54.35FFord Motor$12.72Chevron Corporation (CVX)Source: Denis Kuvaev / Shutterstock.comChevron Corporation(NYSE:CVX) stock is among the top stocks to buy and hold. The oil and gas exploration company was in an uptrend last year, and I expect the positive momentum to sustain. Besides the potential for capital gains, CVX stock also offers an attractive dividend yield of 3.24%.From a fundamental perspective, there are two important reasons to like Chevron. First, the company has an investment-grade balance sheet with a net-debt ratio of 4.9% as of Q3 2022. Further, the company has low break-even assets that enable the generation of robust cash flows.For Q3 2022, Chevronreported an operating cash flow of $13.7 billion. With an annual OCF visibility in excess of $40 billion, Chevron is positioned to make big investments and potentially increase dividends. It’s also worth noting that Chevron has a strong resource base, which implies steady production in the coming years.Lockheed Martin (LMT)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comGlobal defense spending exceeded $2 trillion in 2021. It’s likely that defense spending will continue to increase with several points of geopolitical friction.Lockheed Martin(NYSE:LMT) stock looks attractive and is worth holding in the core portfolio.In the last 12 months, LMT stock has trended higher by 27%, and the stock also offers a dividend yield of 2.59%. As the company’s order backlog swells, it’s likely that investment returns will remain robust. As of Q3 2022, Lockheed reported anorder backlog of $140 billion.For the last quarter, Lockheed reported a free cash flow of $2.7 billion. This implies an annualized FCF potential in excess of $10 billion. Therefore, dividend growth is likely to sustain.Lockheed Martin has also been investing in new technology. This is a catalyst for growth over the next decade. The investments include a focus on hypersonics, directed energy, and autonomy, among others. With a strong balance sheet, Lockheed is also positioned for potential acquisitions in the defense space.Costco Wholesale (COST)Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.comCostco Wholesale(NASDAQ:COST) has been sideways to lower in the last 12 months. This was expected, considering inflationary pressure. Further, the stock has discounted the potential impact of aggressive rate hikes on consumer spending.Besides these near-term headwinds, COST stock is worth holding for the coming years. The U.S. economy is primarily consumption-based, and retail spending is a critical component.Another point to note is that sales growth has been healthy even amidst challenges. For the 18 weeks that ended on Jan. 1, Costco reportedsales growth of 7.6% on a year-on-year basisto $82.16 billion. The outlook remains positive, with comparable store sales growth being healthy in the U.S.Costco also has 66.9 million households as members. This has translated into$4.3 billion in membership feesin the last 12 months. With continued expansion in the U.S. and internationally, recurring income is likely to swell. This will have a sustained positive impact on cash flows.Rio Tinto (RIO)Source: Rob Bayer / Shutterstock.comRio Tinto(NYSE:RIO) looks attractive among commodity stocks to buy and hold forever. The stock has been in an uptrend, with a rally of 35% in the last six months. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 8.8 times, the stock remains a compelling buy. A dividend yield of 9.0% adds to the attractiveness.One reason to like Rio is an investment-grade balance sheet. Further, for the first half of 2022, Rio reported a free cash flow of $7.1 billion. Robust financial flexibility will ensure that dividends sustain. At the same time, Rio is positioned to make big investments to potentially accelerate growth.In December 2022, Riocompleted the acquisitionofTurquoise Hill Resourcesfor a consideration of $3.1 billion. This boosts the company’s copper portfolio. Rio is also positioned to be the largest source oflithium supply in Europefor the next 15 years. With a global push towards green energy, these base metals will drive growth for Rio Tinto.Apple (AAPL)Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comApple’s(NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has been an underperformer in the last 12 months. During this period, the stock declined by 25%. However, the business is a cash flow machine, and Apple is an innovator. The correction provides a good entry opportunity for the long term.From the sales perspective, the iPhone segment remains the key growth driver. At the same time, theservices and wearable segment growthhas been encouraging. With product diversification, the growth outlook is positive.Further, Apple has nearly $170 billion in cash and equivalents. With strong operating cash flows, dividend growth will continue along with share repurchases. Also, Apple is positioned to pursue inorganic growth by investing in innovation-driven start-ups.There are reports that Apple hasdelayed its self-driving car launch until 2026. The company plans to sell consumer models for under $100,000. With a loyal customer base, the launch of the Apple car might be a big growth catalyst.Newmont Corporation (NEM)Source: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockGold has already been trending higher, and there are several long-term catalysts for the precious metal. This includes geopolitical tension, inflation, and a weak dollar.Newmont Corporation(NYSE:NEM) stock is a good proxy for investing in gold. The gold miner has remained subdued in the last 12 months, with gold remaining sideways to lower. NEM stock is, however, attractive at current levels and offers a dividend yield of 4.12%.Newmont Corporation has an investment-grade balance sheet, and that’s a key reason to like the stock. With strong financial flexibility, the company is positioned to sustain dividends and accelerate investments.Newmont has a strong asset base with96 million ounces of proven reserves. With investment in exploration activity, reserve replacement has remained strong. The company expects to deliver steady production through 2040.Therefore, even if gold trades around $2,000 an ounce, Newmont will report robust free cash flows.

TipRanks,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/wall-street-s-strong-buys-2-retail-stocks-with-upside-potential-1032013544,Wall Street’s Strong Buys: 2 Retail Stocks with Upside Potential,"There are still retail stocks with upside potential, even though, with a recession on the horizon, retail sales could take another sharp turn lower. Undoubtedly, many looming retail sales pressures have likely been baked in here. Still, it’s difficult to gauge how much of a hailstorm the retail heavyweights could be in for as the Fed continues pushing rates higher.Wall Street analysts have been cautious regarding the more discretionary retailers. Despite enduring pain in 2022, analysts aren’t yet ready to pound the table on buying the dip with such names as RH (NYSE:RH). RH is an upscale retail play and probably one of the most discretionary names in discretionary retail.Though RH stock has a “Moderate Buy” consensus rating, the stock still has a mere 3.9% expected upside potential. Indeed, the price target downgrades for the stock keep flowing in, and this bar-lowering could continue until this market is ready to look past the damage that a seemingly-imminent recession will bring.Sure, RH stock is more than half off from peak levels. However, the stakes of getting in a tad too early are incredibly high. As such, investors who want decent value in retail may wish to go for a more staples-focused retail play.Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) are two retailers that have done a great job of holding their own in 2022, thanks partly to their grocery exposure and competitive prices. Though their post-recession recovery upside could be limited, I still view both retailers as intriguing options to ride out a few more waves in 2023.In this piece,we’ll compare the two retailersand see where Wall Street stands on them in a probable recession year.Costco (COST)Costco stock has historically traded at a pretty lofty multiple. With rates rising, many premium-priced, growth-focused stocks have felt the hit of a valuation reset. Even after a turbulent 2022, Costco stock still trades at a rich36.4 times trailing earnings multiple. Amid inflation and macro headwinds, though, Costco is one of few firms with some wind to its back. In 2023, the winds could strengthen as more consumers drive to great lengths to save more money.It’s not just looming catalysts (easing margin pressures and a recession-induced bump in foot traffic) that make Costco a great play. The top wholesale retailer has done a great job keeping its members happy. With one of the better value propositions in retail, Costco looks best able to take market share amid lingering inflation and slowing economic growth.The stock sports a low 0.77 beta, meaning Costco is slightly less volatile than the rest of the market. Should the bear market test new lows, Costco’s low beta should come in handy for jittery investors.Costco is one of the best defensive retailers to hold going into a period of economic turbulence. Still, investors will pay up for such premium exposure.What is the Price Target for COST Stock?Turning to Wall Street, analysts expect continued gains. The average COST stock price target sits at $554.09. From here, that’s a nearly 14.9% gain to be had.Walmart (WMT)Walmart is another resilient retailer that’s used its size to its advantage. The iconic retailer is well-known for having some of the lowest prices. As inflation sticks around while employment numbers are put to the test, the path of least resistance for WMT stock, I believe, is higher.In recent quarters, inventory challenges have taken a stride out of Walmart’s step. Still, management seems more up to dealing with inventory gluts relative to peers.Last month, Credit Suisse praised Walmart as a defensive pick for an uncertain year. Specifically, they outlined the firm’s ability to “play offense” in difficult environments. Undoubtedly, Walmart has a lot of growth levers it can pull while the economic tides begin to fall. There’s plenty of room to run on e-commerce. Further, the firm could continue to spruce up its Walmart+ subscription offering.Now, it’s a long shot to think Walmart+ can catch up to the likes of a Costco membership. Regardless, 2023 could be an opportunity for Walmart to gain ground over peers less competitive on price.At44.8 times trailing earnings, WMT stock looks expensive, but as a high-quality defensive that can swim forward in a recession year, a strong case could be made that Walmart presents compelling value.What is the Price Target for WMT Stock?Wall Street loves Walmart for its stability. The average WMT stock price target of $162.38 entails an 11.1% gain from here based on 20 Buys and five Holds assigned in the past three months.The TakeawayNot all retailers are created the same. The following grocery-heavy retail plays are great buys, according to Wall Street. Nonetheless, analysts expect slightly more upside from Costco over the next 12 months.Disclosure",15d

With the U.S. economy adding 223,000 jobs in December and the unemployment rate dropping to 3.5%, some market participants fear that the Federal Reserve might choose to hike interest rates further than they want and potentially spark a recession. Others appreciate that the economy has been resilient in the face of tighter monetary policy, though. That debate had stock index futures moving sharply in both directions early Friday before the open of the regular trading session, although it appeared bullish investors might win out as of 9 a.m. ET.Consumers are responsible for a huge portion of the overall economy, so what happens in the retail industry has a key impact on the broader picture for stock investors.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this warehouse club operator have returned -6.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -4.6% change. The Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry, to which Costco belongs, has lost 3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Costco is expected to post earnings of $3.20 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $14.26 points to a change of +8.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $15.67 indicates a change of +9.9% from what Costco is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.9%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Costco.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Costco, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $55.6 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +7.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $243.43 billion and $257.54 billion estimates indicate +7.3% and +5.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCostco reported revenues of $54.44 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.1%. EPS of $3.10 for the same period compares with $2.97 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $54.67 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.42%. The EPS surprise was -1.27%.Over the last four quarters, Costco surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Costco is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Costco. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double"" From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come.

TipRanks,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tight-jobs-market-in-december-offset-by-wage-gains-1032004365,Tight Jobs Market in December Offset by Wage Gains,"It’s awfully difficult to put financial investors in a positive mood when the Federal Reserve is threatening to potentially continue raising interest rates throughout 2023. The last thing traders need now is a strong employment report, but that’s exactly what they got this morning. On the other hand, there is some bad news mixed in with the good news, which (oddly enough) was received positively by stock traders.The Labor Department’s December nonfarm payrolls report indicated that the U.S. added 223,000 jobs during that month. That’s well above the 200,000 jobs that economists had anticipated.In other words, the American jobs market isn’t cooling off as quickly as expected. Why would this be a problem? It’s because a hot jobs market could be perceived by the Federal Reserve as a sign that inflation will remain elevated.That, in turn, could prompt the central bank to aggressively raise the federal funds rate, which affects the country’s interest rates generally. Thus, we have “good news for the economy is bad news for the stock market” scenario.Stocks Jump after the Release of the Employment DataDespite the hotter-than-expected nonfarm payrolls print, the major U.S. indices jolted upwards soon after the data was released. By 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time in premarket trading, the S&P 500 (SPX) was up 0.65%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rose 0.68%, and Nasdaq 100 (NDX) gained 0.5% compared to yesterday’s closing prices.Most likely, the Nasdaq 100 was weighed down by Tesla , which was down 6% to 7% because the automaker is cutting its vehicle prices in China. On the other hand, notable morning runners included more defensive names like Costco Wholesale , up nearly 3% in premarket trading, as well as Visa (NYSE: V), up 1.5%.What put the market in such a positive mood? Reportedly, U.S. wages only grew 0.3% month-over-month in December, whereas economists had expected 0.4% wage growth. Somehow, stock traders were able to ignore the sizable increase in nonfarm payrolls and instead focus on slower-than-anticipated growth in workers’ wages.Whether the day will end as optimistically as it began remains to be seen. Ultimately, it’s just more data for both the bulls and bears to add to their arsenals.Disclosure",20d

COST bounced 2.2% off a 6 1/2-month low in premarket trading Friday, after the membership-based warehouse retailer reported upbeat December sales. The company reported late Thursday net sales of $23.80 billion for the month of December, up 7.0% from the same period a year ago. For the five weeks to Jan. 1, comparable-store sales (comps) excluding gasoline sales and currency impacts rose 7.3% from a year ago. That compares with a 5.3% rise in November, the FactSet consensus for the fiscal second-quarter through February of 5.2%. “This is the first major retailer to provide an indication of December results and the rebound versus November to better-than-expected comps endorses the theory that holiday sales came late in 2022 after a slow start in November,” D.A. Davidson analyst Michael Baker wrote in a note to clients. He reiterated his neutral rating on the stock but raised his price target to $478 from $423. The stock, which closed Thursday at the lowest price since June 17, 2022, has lost 6.7% over the past three months, while the SPDR Consumer Staples Select Sector ETF XLP has rallied 9.3% and the S&P 500 SPX has gained 1.7%.Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

InvestorPlace,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/undervalued-large-cap-stocks-1031616536,7 Seriously Undervalued Large-Cap Stocks to Buy Now,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsUndervalued large-cap stocks present a particularly good opportunity right now with all three major indices in the U.S. continuing to trend lower to start the New Year.The latest data out of the U.S. showed that inflation rose 7.1% in November from a year ago, which is still well above the Fed’s 2% target. This raises the likelihood that the central bank will continue raising its benchmark interest rate in the coming months, albeit at a slower pace than in previous months.As rates continue inching higher and inflation slowly decelerates, stocks are likely to remain volatile. But the retreat of the markets seen in 2022 (the worst year for equities since the 2008 financial crisis) has left many large-cap stocks deeply undervalued. This presents an opportunity for investors who can tolerate the near-term ups and downs of the market and keep their eyes fixed on the long-term.Here are seven seriously undervalued large-cap stocks to buy now.AMZNAmazon$83.55NVDANvidia$143NKENike$122AAPLApple$126COSTCostco$452MSFTMicrosoft$224AXPAmerican Express$145Undervalued Large-Cap Stocks: Amazon (AMZN)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAmazon(NASDAQ:AMZN) stock is now trading under $85 a share, its most affordable level in more than five years.Following Amazon’sdisappointing third-quarter earnings and lowered guidance, AMZN stock is down 50% in the last 12 months. Even a 20-for-1 stock splitundertaken at the beginning of June hasn’t helped the share price.Having given up most of the gains it achieved during the pandemic when consumers were forced to shop online, AMZN stock seems to have been abandoned by consumers. Yet analysts say that is a mistake, and the company is poised for a rebound.For its part, Amazon is doing what it can to try to raise its share price, as the company earlier this year announced a$10 billion stock buyback program.Amazon also completed its secondPrime sales event of the year in mid-October, which should give its fourth-quarter earnings a boost. Further, the company has reduced its staff levelsand taken other cost-cutting measures as it tries to adjust to the current economic environment.While Amazon’s price-earnings (P/E) ratio remains a hefty 75 times, it is not that high when one considers the company’s nearly $1 trillion market capitalization or that it generates more than $100 billion of revenue each quarter. Take advantage of the shares’ weakness and buy the dip of AMZN stock.Nvidia (NVDA)Source: ShutterstockFew large-cap technology stocks have been beaten down as much as semiconductor companyNvidia(NASDAQ:NVDA). NVDA stock has tumbled 50% in the last year to $143. In November 2021, the company’s shares were trading above $300, and that was after a 4-for-1 stock split.The share price has been hurt by mounting fears that the demand for Nvidia’s chips and semiconductors will slow along with the global economy. To be sure, the company’s earnings for the third quarterwere a disaster with revenue down 17% year-over-year. The Q3 print didn’t help the share price at all.Nvidia has also lowered its forward guidance multiple times this year. It most recently said that it expects about $6 billion of sales in Q4, lower than the average estimate of $6.09 billion among analysts who cover the company.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has stressed that the company isgrappling witha “challenging macro environment.” Still, Nvidia, whose chips are used in everything from supercomputers to artificial intelligence applications, remainsa solid, long-term buy.Its P/E ratio is high at 61 times, but that has come down over the last year with the share price. And, unlike many tech stocks, Nvidia pays a dividend that yields 0.11%. It’s not the most generous dividend, but it helps make NVDA one of the more reliable undervalued large-cap stocksto buy.Nike (NKE)Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.comThe shares of the world’s largest supplier of athletic shoes and apparel have been pummeled over the past year. The stock of Oregon-based Nike(NYSE:NKE) hasplunged 27% and now trades at $122 per share. The decline, while no doubt troubling to shareholders, makes NKE stock a screaming buy.A year ago, Nike’s stock was trading at $167 a share. Its big decline has been due largely to the same issues that are vexing companies all over the world: Supply chain problems, excess inventories, Covid-19 lockdowns in China, and slowing consumer spending.Just before Christmas, Nike reported fiscal second quarter earnings that surpassed the average outlook of the analysts on Wall Street, sending its stock more than 10% higher in a single trading session.The shoemaker announced quarterly earnings per share of 85 cents versus the mean estimate of 64 cents. Its revenue came in at $13.32 billion compared to the $12.57 billion that had been expected.NKE’s price-earnings ratio of 34 is slightly high, but it’s justified given the company’s market-leading position. And NKE stock pays a quarterly dividend that yields 1.1%. Grab this stockwhile it remains on sale.Undervalued Large-Cap Stocks: Apple (AAPL)Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comApple’s(NASDAQ:AAPL) stock just keeps getting more affordable and attractive. Its share price fell 15% in December alone, bringing its 2022 decline to 30%. The consumer electronics giant’s stock is now trading right around $125.Analysts’ median price target on AAPL stock is currently $175 a share, which is nearly 40% higher than its current level. The shares’ P/E ratio of 20 times is the lowest it has been in years and the stock pays a dividend that yields 0.73%.With Apple, investors also get a company that buys back more of its own stock than any other publicly traded concern. The company most recently announced that its board of directors had greenlit a $90 billion share buyback program.Apple is also increasingly diversified, venturing into new areas ranging from streaming to buy now, pay later. Further, with its iPhones and Mac computers., Apple remains the world’s leading consumer electronics companyAs with many companies, Apple is dealing with issues that include supply chain constraints, wage inflation and slowing consumer spending in the face of rising interest rates. Its iPhone production has also been hurt byCovid-19 lockdowns in China.AAPL stock took it on the chin after the company announced that it wasscaling back productionof its new iPhone 14 due to the issues in China and weaker consumer demand than forecast. The company’smost recent earnings report was mixed but managed to beat analysts’ average expectations.Apple’s lower share price should make the stock more appealing to value investors.Costco (COST)Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.comThe shares of big-box grocery retailerCostco(NASDAQ:COST) are down 19% over the past 12 months. COST’s 52-week low is $406, well below its current level of $452. The retailer has managed to recover by demonstrating that its sales remain strong despite high inflation and rising interest rates.The company’s November sales figureswere mixed. Costco said its net sales for the period came in at $19.17 billion, up 5.7% year over year. However, the firm’s e-commerce sales fell 10.1% during the period. COST stock declined 3% on the data.However, Costco has retained the loyalty of its customers by announcing that it wouldnot raise its membership feesthis year, holding them at $60 for a regular annual membership and $120 for an executive membership.The stock’s P/E ratio of 35 times looks high at first glance, but investors need to keep in mind that Costco is on track to surpass $200 billion of sales for 2022, making it one of the more impressive undervalued large-cap stocks .The company’s stock pays a dividend that yields 0.79%, but Costco has a history of paying out special, one-time dividendsas well.Microsoft (MSFT)Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.comSeattle-basedMicrosoft(NASDAQ:MSFT) is a seriously undervalued technology stock. Founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975 and publicly traded since March 1986, Microsoft today is a well-diversified and battle-tested technology company that is involved in everything from computer software and video games to online search and cloud computing.The company ishugely profitable andgenerates positive cash flow. And its stock has been a consistent winner for shareholders over the years.WhileMSFT stock is down 30% in the last year, it is up 160% over the past five years and has gained more than 500% over the last decade. Today Microsoft has a market capitalization of $1.67 trillion, a reasonable price-earnings ratio of 24, and is one of the few mega-cap tech stocks that actually pays shareholders a quarterly dividend (Its payout currently yields 1.13%).While the company hasnot been immune to the economic challenges afflicting the global economy, it remains one of the tech giants best positioned to weather the storm and come out stronger on the other side.Currently trading at $224 a share, MSFT stock is definitely worth buying at its current levels.Undervalued Large-Cap Stocks: American Express (AXP)Source: ShutterstockThe shares of credit-card giantAmerican Express(NYSE:AXP) are fresh off a52-week low and currently trading right around $145. Down 13% in the last year, AXP stock is at its most affordable level since the pandemic struck in March 2020.The stock’s price-earnings ratio of 15 times is right around the average of companies listed in the S&P 500 index. It pays a 1.4% quarterly dividend.With people all over the world traveling and vacationing again, there’s every reason to bebullish on AXP stockand the company’s future earnings.But don’t take our word for it. Consider that American Express is one of legendary investorWarren Buffett’s favorite stocks. The Oracle of Omaha has held his current position in AXP stock for more than 30 years and never sold a single share.Besides its traditional credit card loans, American Express also operates an end-to-end payment system that facilitates transactions between consumers and businesses. Revenue from those transactions is today the company’s biggest source of revenue.On the date of publication, Joel Bagloleheld long positions in NVDA, MSFT and AAPL.

The broad-based decline of equities means that some of the best-run and most dominant companies in the U.S. have undervalued stocks to buy. These names are trading at a huge discount relative to their current and future earnings.The share prices of many highly profitable, market-leading companies have sunk by 50% or more during the current rout, in many cases erasing the gains that they achieved during the pandemic.This presents a hugebuying opportunity for investors looking to put capital to work in a weak market. And while we may not have achieved a bottom just yet, there are plenty of undervalued stocks to buy at fire-sale prices.These stocks should pay off handsomely once the market does bottom and share prices permanently reverse higher.Here are seven of the most undervalued stocks to buy now.GOOGAlphabet$89.40HDHome Depot$314AMDAdvanced Micro Devices$64.30BABoeing$194PFEPfizer$51.10JPMJPMOrgan Chase$135TGTTarget$151.50Undervalued Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Source: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.comAlphabet(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock isn’t likely to be this affordable again for a very long time.Following the Google parent company’smost recent earnings report, GOOGL stock dropped 6% making it easily one of the best undervalued stocks to buy.YouTube’s ad revenue fell 2% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2022, while analysts, on average, were expecting an increase of 3%. Alphabet announced several cost-cutting measures, canceling the next generation of its Pixelbook laptop computer and announcing plans to close Stadia, its digital gaming service. The company also said that it is likely to reduce its workforce in the coming months.The added pressure on GOOGL stock following the Q3 earnings has dragged the shares down a total of 39% in the past 2 months. (A 20-for-1 stock splitin July also lowered the share price). While discouraging, the decline makes Alphabet stock look very attractive at its current levels.The company’s price-earnings (P/E) ratio has dropped along with the share price to an attractive level of 17 times, which is below the large-cap technology stocks’ average of 25 times.This year’s pullback is one of the steepest in the company’s history. Investors should take advantage of this rare opportunity.Home Depot (HD)Source: Rob Wilson / Shutterstock.comDown 23% over the past year, Home Depot(NYSE:HD) recently was at its lowest level since before Covid, making it one of the undervalued stocks to buy before a comeback.The decline of the retailer’s share price hardly seems justified, considering that the Atlanta-based company reported solid third-quarter earnings.Home Depot continues to manage inflationary pressures. The company has been focused on serving professional home builders and contractors rather than putting its efforts toward serving do-it-yourself renovators and weekend warriors.The company’s sales to professionals continue to exceed its revenue from do-it-yourself projects. The firm’s strong Q3 earnings show that Home Depot has been unfairly dragged lower by the market’s downturn.Add in a P/E ratio on HD stock of 19 and a quarterly dividend that yields 2.41%, and it’s easy to make the case that investors should buy HD stock on the dip.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comAdvanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ:AMD) has beenespecially hard hit, down 57% in the last year, making it one of the undervalued stocks to buy on an anticipated chip turnaround.In mid-October, investors could purchase the shares of AMD for $55 each, around the same level at which the stock was trading in May 2020. While AMD doesn’t pay a dividend, the company’s earnings have continued to be stellar, and its outlook is strong despite its ongoing challenges caused by supply-chain issues and inflationary pressures.On Nov. 1, the company reported third-quarter results that fell short of Wall Street analysts’ average expectations. However, the company still posted revenue growth of nearly 30% for the July through September period.AMD’s latest earnings were also negatively impacted by charges stemming from its$49 billion acquisition of Xilinx in February 2022. Xilinx makes specialty microchips called “field-programmable gate arrays.” Despite its short-term challenges and one-time charges, AMD remains a top semiconductor stock that investors should buy while it’s on sale.Boeing (BA)Source: vaalaa / Shutterstock.comBoeing Company(NYSE:BA) stock was down for the count before last year’s market downturn.Several high-profile crashes of its aircraft in the last few years had created a crisis of confidence in the Virginia-based manufacturer of passenger airplanes. However, all indications are that Boeing hasturned the pageand is moving forward with more stringent safety guidelines.However, this fact hasn’t helped keep BA stock off the list of undervalued stocks to buy. The stock has fallen nearly 10% in the last 12 months.Investors willing to be patient with BA stock should consider the fact that Boeing is part of a duopoly when it comes to aircraft manufacturing. That’s because France’sAirbus SE(OTC:EADSY) is the only other reputable company in the world that manufactures a high number of commercial passenger airplanes.This gives Boeing an enormous advantage and puts the company in a strong competitive position. While investors continue to fret about the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)looking over the shouldersof Boeing’s executives and engineers, they miss the fact that the company continues towin lucrative contractsaround the world as airlines move to replace their aircraft fleets.Pfizer (PFE)Source: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.comPfizer(NYSE:PFE) is one of the world’s premier pharmaceutical companies, as well as one of the best undervalued stocks to buy right now. The company makes severalblockbuster drugs.In late 2020, the company’s Covid-19 vaccine hit the market. Pfizer sold $36.7 billion worth of Covid-19 vaccines globally in 2021, representing 45% of its total revenue. In 2022, the company forecast Covid-19 vaccine sales of $54.5 billion, including booster shots.Despite the successful addition of its Covid-19 vaccine and the multi-billion dollars of revenue that it has brought in, PFE stock has declined 10% during the past year. The company’s price-earnings ratio is a modest 9.87, suggesting the stock is cheap at its current levels.Investors who snap up the shares will also benefit from a quarterly dividend that yields 3.20%. Meanwhile, Pfizer is continuing to develop its Covid-19 pillcalled “Paxlovid,” and some analysts say the pill could be Pfizer’s next blockbuster medicationif it gets approved by the FDA.JPMorgan Chase (JPM)Source: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.comJPMorgan Chase(NYSE:JPM) is the biggest lender in America with nearly $4 trillion of assets under management, and the largest bank in the world with a market capitalization of $393 billion. It is also one of the better undervalued stocks to buy in the banking sector.JPMorgan Chase’s Q3 earnings did not disappoint investors. Its earnings serve as a bellwether for the banking industry, and the results bolstered sentiment among investors.While JPMorgan’s investment banking and equity trading units slowed in Q3, the bank offset those declines with greater income generated from higher interest rates charged on its loans, and also through a bump in its revenue from bond trading.JPM stock is currently down about 16% in the last year year. However, the bank’s share price has gained 26% in the past three months. The shares also currently have a low price-earnings ratio of 11.5 and pay a quarterly dividend that yields 2.9%.Undervalued Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Target (TGT)Source: jejim / Shutterstock.comTarget(NYSE:TGT) stock has dropped 36% in the last year, making it one of the most undervalued stocks in retail.The shares of the big-box department store chain had been holding up fairly well until April. That’s when the companyreported Q1 earningsthat showed that inflation had affected its bottom line and that it had excessive inventory.While Target has made progress in unwinding its inventories, the company continues to struggle with a host of issues. In mid-November, Target reported a Q3 earnings miss, warned of soft holiday sales, and trimmed its Q4 guidance.As one might expect, the Q3 print didn’t go over well with analysts or investors. Target cited inflationary pressures that are forcing consumers to prioritize spending as the reason for the poor financial results and difficult outlook. Target also announced plans to cut $3 billion of costs by 2025On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in GOOGL.

InvestorPlace,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/10-stocks-under-10-for-2023-1031998337,10 Stocks Under $10 for 2023,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWelcome to January! The season of holiday gifts… yet-to-be-broken resolutions……And the unsolicited nuggets of investment advice.Investors can be forgiven for ignoring the counsel this year. As James Mackintosh of the Wall Street Journal put it, analysts nailed earnings forecasts in 2022 and then completely missed the massive bear market.“You can be exactly right and dead wrong at the same time.”Many of my own Moonshot picks suffered too at the hands of an aggressive Federal Reserve. My no. 1 choice POSaBIT (OTCMKTS:POSAF) and no. 3 Ethereum (ETH-USD) fell 43% and 67%, respectively, even as the former posted record results and the latter dominated the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).Nevertheless, 2022 still had many bright spots. My no. 2 pick Volt Information Sciences rose by over 107% (before being acquired by Vega Consulting in late April), while plenty of other recommendations like Enservco (NYSE:ENSV) saw massive 500%-plus spikes in the energy price run-up. And though I didn’t get out at the top of the crypto market, my mid-year firesale helped my portfolio escape another 40% fall in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices and the total collapse of exchanges like FTX (FTT-USD).For an analyst tasked with identifying longshot investments, 2022 could have gone far worse.How to Invest in 2023So, howshould we invest in 2023 to avoid the same mistakes of 2022?Start with what wedo know: a recession is likely this year.The signs are flashing brighter than Rudolph’s nose at a Christmas concert. High inflation… job cuts… smaller holiday gifts… If we aren’t already in a recession, we’re likely to be in one soon.But then, things get trickier as confounding factors enter. And why market analysts can often be so right, and yet so wrong.In a perfect “soft landing,” America avoids a deeper downturn. In this version of the future, cyclical stocks will soar, and Jerome Powell gets remembered as a genius. Investors in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) could quickly find themselves owning trillion-dollar companies by the end of 2023.In an alternate universe, the Fed, or its international counterparts, unintentionally triggers a deeper global recession. That would mean non-cyclical stocks like American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) will outperform. Even if you can’t afford a new Tesla, you still need to flush the toilet!So, how can investors protect themselves in both cases?Protect Your Investments in 2023That’s where an investment in consumer and healthcare stocks comes in. According to a long-term study by Fidelity Investments, a combination of 1) consumer staples, 2) consumer cyclical, and 3) healthcare is the best way to outperform in both a recession and an early-stage business cycle. Telecom and utilities will outperform in a recession only. And because we don’t know whenthe recession will end, this provides us with the safest way of protecting a portfolio during a downturn, while avoiding a potential market recovery.That said, investors still need to stay selective. Someconsumer staples companies like Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) have already been bid up to rich valuations, reducing their potential upsides. Others like tobacco giant Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) have found themselves on the wrong side of history. These types of stocks will struggle to break higher, even as economic growth returns.That means investors should favor low-valued stocks going into 2023 — the types with a limited downside in an economic recession, and plenty of upside in an alternate case.10 Stocks Under $10 for 2023To identify these ten high-potential stocks, I’ve run my Profit & Protection quantitative investment system on all U.S. listed stocks from the three sectors listed above. The top companies are then checked for their underlying performance and listed below.1. RealReal (NASDAQ:REAL). This e-commerce business for used luxury goods uses a vast network of local consignors to gather, grade and price incoming inventory. It’s a system that has helped RealReal differentiate itself from peer-to-peer competitors like eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and achieve supernormal growth. Analysts expect REAL to generate another 28% in revenue growth to top off last year’s 57% increase.The company, of course, is as risky as they come. Shares trade for around a dollar and the e-commerce outfit could realistically go bankrupt before minting a single shred of profits.Still, history tells us that these all-or-nothing cases tend to outperform over the long run, provided you place enough bets to mitigate the risk. A sparing bet in the cheapest stock on this list could help supercharge a portfolio at relatively little cost.2. Harvard Biosciences (NASDAQ:HBIO). This laboratory and testing equipment firm is a “picks and shovels” play on the biotech industry. 2022 revenues are virtually unchanged from 2019 levels, while shares trade at around a 20-25% discount from historical averages. A market recovery in 2023 should help shares rise back into the $4 range.That said, the firm is still risky at best. Harvard Biosciences reinvests less than its peers in creating new products, putting it on a long-term fundamental path to obsolescence. And a prolonged slump in the biotech industry could create more unexpected losses for HBIO. But much like RealReal, history tells us that it’s firms like these that tend to outperform when market recoveries eventually happen.3. Latham Group (NASDAQ:SWIM). One of America’s largest providers of pool products is also one of its cheapest. Shares trade for only 6X forward price-to-earnings and 0.5 times price-to-sales on account of lower forecasted 2023 profits. Wall Street expects net income to drop 33% next year as customers pull back from large discretionary purchases.Still, consumer cyclical stocks don’t stay down forever. The same analysts are expecting 2024 profits to return to normal. And with shares at only $3, Latham Group is a compelling bet on America’s eventual return to better times.4. WW International (NASDAQ:WW). The profitable weight loss firm trades as an equity stub sitting on a mound of long-term debt. It’s a double-edged sword that propelled shares into the $40 range in 2021, and then sent the stock under $4 where it remains today.That makes it a particularly attractive bet for risk-seeking investors who believe 2023 will see a milder-than-expected recession. For every 10% increase in WW’s enterprise value, its share price goes up by a stunning 56%. And on the downside, the most you can lose is… well… $4 per share.5. Tupperware Brands (NYSE:TUP).The Orlando-based direct seller of food storage and kitchenware has only been cheaper once in its years as a public company during March-April 2020.Today, shares of the firm are once again trading at these record-low figures thanks to a pullback in analyst expectations. Wall Street now expects TUP to generate only $1.2 billion in 2023 revenues and 90 cents EPS compared to prior expectations of $1.9 billion and $3.8 EPS a year ago.Still, direct-selling models are surprisingly resilient. According to data from IBISWorld, the direct-selling industry grew another 4.3% in 2022 to cap off a decade of expansion. Provided Tupperware can avoid the missteps of other “pyramid-scheme” companies, shares could easily rise 2X from current levels.6. DarioHealth (NASDAQ:DRIO). The New-York based healthcare firm has long focused on creating health tools for direct-to-consumer sales. Products include glucose monitoring kits and other connected devices. In 2020, the firm began expanding into business-to-business (B2B) sales. Revenues this year are now expected to be almost 4X higher than before and analysts expect another 25% growth in 2023.Shares, of course, are cheap because the firm has been unprofitable since 2011. It could take another three to four years for the firm to break even. But if history is any guide, a faster-than-expected stock market recovery could send DRIO’s stock up 100% or more in short order. Companies that have found a cheap way to scale up rarely stay unprofitable forever.7. HanesBrands (NYSE:HBI). The vertically integrated maker of underwear and other innerwear is a surprisingly cyclical stock, at least from a valuation standpoint. Shares have traded as low as 5X forward P/E and as high as 20X.Today, the firm trades at only 5.4X forward P/E, a near-record low. And with Street estimates pointing to a stabilization in 2023 revenue and EPS, investors should consider what would be my no. 1 pick for 2023.8. Carnival (NYSE:CCL). The cruise line owner/operator now trades at half its pandemic-era lows. At the same time, 2023 operating earnings are now expected to return to 2019 levels. According to the Profit & Protection system, it’s these types of turnarounds that tend to do well over the next twelve months.Investors should remain cautious, of course. Carnival’s fleet is unsellable during crisis periods, making a sum-of-the-parts valuation largely useless. But for risk-seeking investors, this is a bet that’s looking more attractive to make.9. Lifetime Brands (NASDAQ:LCUT).The kitchenware and tableware firm is a relatively stable play on consumer demand. Revenues rose 4.7% in 2020 as customers shopped for home goods, and then continued going up another 12% in 2021. The firm owns household brand names from Pfaltzgraff to Mikasa.2022 will be a tougher year, with rising retailer inventories sending sales back down to 2019 levels. LCUT shares have dropped almost 60% as a result. Still, the New York-based company has seen this story before. Each time its stock has fallen below $10, it has eventually returned to the $15 range as demand recovers.10. Under Armour (NYSE:UAA). The former high-flying maker of sportswear and sneakers finds itself in the “value” dustbin after three bruising years of sagging sales. Shares are down 62% since mid-2019, and analysts are expecting a 20% decline in EBITDA for 2022.Yet, like most of the companies on this list, Under Armour still has some fight left in it. Street estimates are now calling for a 29% recovery in net income for 2023. And competitors like Nike (NYSE:NKE) are slowly reporting easing supply gluts. Investors might have to wait longer on this firm, but an economic recovery should send shares back into the $15-20 level. At the time of writing, UAA stock is already inching up to the $10 price mark.Conclusion: How to Invest in 2023For investors looking to invest in 2023, it helps to view the stock market as a dog on a leash. The dog-walker (i.e., a company’s fundamentals) will tend to keep a predictable, steady pace. Market analysts excel at forecasting these things.Meanwhile, the dog itself (i.e., a stock’s price) might run ahead…Then fall behind…And then get distracted by a squirrel…It’s these price actions that analysts are generally poor at forecasting. When investor emotions are involved, prices can detach from the fundamentals for a while.The dog/dog-walker situation is also why certain sectors do well in specific market cycles. Investors seeking “safe havens” stocks will often rush into the same trades, driving prices away from their long-run values. The same holds true for growth stocks, real estate, bonds and more. And investors who recognize this will perform far better in 2023, a year where the only certain thing is that markets will be uncertain.On Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions,InvestorPlacedoes not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

TipRanks,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/2-stocks-to-shield-your-portfolio-from-a-looming-recession-1031997234,2 Stocks to Shield Your Portfolio from a Looming Recession,"The threat of recession looms large in 2023. AWall Street Journalreport highlighted that the majority of economists at top financial institutions believe that the U.S. will steer into recession in 2023. These market pundits blame the U.S. Fed’s aggressive stance toward controlling inflation through rate hikes for their gloomy outlook. A recession may or may not hit, but investors can add a safety net to their portfolios and limit the downside risk through defensive stocks like Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).The defensive nature of their businesses and their value offerings help these companies perform well in an economic slowdown. However, investors should take caution, as shares of these companies are not completely immune to a recessionary situation. Let’s dig deeper.Is Costco Doing Well Financially?Costco has performed exceptionally well in 2022 despite macro headwinds and is financially strong. Its solid membership base and value proposition continue to drive traffic, which in turn leads to comparable sales. Its membership renewal rates remain high (they stood at 92.5% for the U.S. and Canada in Q1), which is encouraging and adds stability to its business.Jefferies analystCorey Tarlowebelieves that COST’s higher mix of food (as a percentage of overall sales), value offerings, and membership model position it well to gain market share even amid a tough macro backdrop.Tarlowe noted that Costco’s traffic remains healthy, with consumables driving higher sell-through. The analyst is bullish about Costco’s prospects and recommends a Buy.Including Tarlowe, COST stock has received 18 Buy recommendations. Furthermore, it has received five Holds. Overall, COST has a Strong Buy consensus rating on TipRanks. Moreover, analysts’ average price target of $557.14 implies 22.05% upside potential.While analysts show confidence in COST stock, it has a negative signal from hedge funds and insiders.Hedge funds sold 1.8M COST stock last quarter. During the same time,insiders sold COST stock worth $3.6M. Overall, it carries a Neutral Smart Score of six.Is Walmart a Buy, Sell, or Hold?Walmart is the world’s leading retailer and is known for its value pricing and wide assortments that resonate well with consumers. During the Q3 conference call, its CEODoug McMillonhighlighted that WMT sells things that people want at a value price in a difficult macro environment. This adds resiliency to Walmart’s business and positions it well to succeed in a challenging operating environment.Credit Suisse analystKaren Shortis bullish about WMT stock and sees it as a well-positioned defensive bet in an uncertain economic environment. Short added that its value offerings and wide price gaps compared to conventional grocers would likely accelerate market share gains in a weak macro backdrop.Including Short, Walmart stock has received 21 Buys. Also, five analysts recommended a Hold on WMT stock. It sports a Strong Buy consensus rating on TipRanks. Meanwhile, these analysts’ average price target of $162.96 implies 14.93% upside potential.Besides for analysts, hedge funds are also bullish about WMT stock.Hedge funds bought 6.9M worth of WMT stocklast quarter. However,insiders sold WMT stock worth $3.9B. Overall, WMT stock carries an Outperform Smart Score of nine on TipRanks.Bottom LineAs the likelihood of inflation grows, these companies are well-positioned to gain market share and deliver healthy growth due to their defensive businesses. Adding these stocks to your portfolio will likely add stability and reduce downside risk.Disclosure",23d
InvestorPlace,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/best-stocks-for-beginners-1031607349,7 Stocks for Beginners to Buy Now,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe best stocks for beginners to buy now include the right amount of risk.People with a longer investment horizon could take the conservative route, buying value stocks and low-cost ETFs, but a long horizon also means they can take some risks as well.A moderate-risk approach to investing for the beginner makes the most sense. It includes a lot of growth potential balanced by several dividend-bearing shares while benefitting from secular trends. This list of the best stocks for beginners to buy now includes a balanced approach that could be adjusted later but which will teach an investor about the broader market.BRK.BBerkshire Hathaway$308.90XPEVXPeng$9.94MSFTMicrosoft’s$239.82FSRFisker$7.27COSTCostco$456.50BRMKBroadmark Realty Capital$3.56KOCoca-Cola$63.61Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) is one of the best stocks for beginners tobuy now. Berkshire Hathaway’s holdings can be seen here.The primary benefit of the Berkshire Hathaway investment style is its safety and long-term gains. In a down market like that which we’re currently experiencing, BRK.B stock will tend to outperform. Case in point: BRK.B shares slid 2.94% in Q3. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 declined roughly 6.3% during the same period.BRK.B is a great starter for a beginner investor, especially those who are more risk-averse. Those investors will find that Berkshire Hathaway may provide lower returns in the short term but with less stress.XPeng (XPEV)Source: shutterstock.com/Robert WayXPeng (NYSE:XPEV) lies decisively on the growth side of the spectrum, but still is one of the best stocks for beginners to buy. XPeng is squarely at the front of exciting growth. It produces vehicles in the fast-growing electric vehicle segment. And it does so primarily in China, the largest and fastest-growing EV market globally.XPEV stock is much cheaper now than it was at the beginning of 2022. It has fallen from $50 to below $10. XPEV is now cheap and is nearly guaranteed to appreciate in price rapidly when the business cycle again favors growth stocks.Microsoft (MSFT)Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.comBeginner investors who understand Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) returns over the past decade should quickly recognize why it’s one of the best stocks for beginners to buy. Over the past 10 years, MSFT stock has provided an annual return of 27.14%. An investor with a set-it-and-forget-it mentality would have seen their capital multiply in value by 11X during that same period.Whether interest rates remain higher or not, Microsoft is a great stock to own. The company has a long history of creating value based on a return on invested capital of 28.5% which is more than quadruple its cost of capital. There is little to suggest that it won’t continue to do the same moving forward.Fisker (FSR)Source: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.comFisker (NYSE:FSR) has just begun production and remains a bright spot among a wasteful period of SPAC-funded startup fervor that saw a lot of investors get burned.Fisker’s asset-light operating model is just beginning to prove what many suspected all along: The company made great choices that will serve it well in the long run. Those choices really boil down to Fisker’s decision to outsource the manufacturing of its Ocean SUV. The result is that production of the Fisker Ocean began on Nov. 17 as promised.The company relied on Magna (NYSE:MGA) to manufacture the vehicle in Austria, depending on the firm’s long pedigree in outsourced automotive manufacturing.Investors should understand that several of Fisker’s SPAC competitors are simply gone now. Others will have far less financial flexibility after building manufacturing from the ground up. Expect the Ocean to be more reliable given Magna’s history and experience. Expect FSR stock price to rise because of the prudent decisions making it one of the best stocks for beginners to buy.Costco (COST)Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.comCostco (NASDAQ:COST) is arguably the best stock to buy in today’s environment. It encompasses defensive positioning with strong exposure to the consumer staples sector. The company sells staple consumer items in bulk including things like bulk pasta, rice, meat, vegetables, and other foods along with personal items like tissues. Those items are among the last to fall off of a grocery list meaning they have high demand inelasticity.That said, COST stock remains down this year by 19%. Costco shares have seen periods of rapid growth and price appreciation during 2022. They cooled as retail worries mounted. That’s where they are currently: Down after mounting concerns again. Experts expect Costco to move up again in 2023 and it is cheap now so all investors ought to consider it.Broadmark Realty Capital (BRMK)Source: Maryna Pleshkun/Shutterstock.comBroadmark Realty Capital (NYSE:BRMK) is a REIT (real estate income trust) which means by law it must pay 90%of its annual taxable income to shareholders as dividends. REITs are a great investment class for those seeking income. That said, they are risky. REITs invest in large portfolios of real estate using significant leverage. That means they sometimes end up underwater, unable to service the loans they’ve assumed to control vast quantities of real estate assets.REITs, as a class of stocks, are less liquid than other stock classes and bonds, but the upside is the income they provide. Broadmark Realty Capital includes a dividend yielding 11.3% annually and pays on a monthly basis. That allows for faster reinvestment than a quarterly dividend and could thus lead to higher returns in the long run.Coca-Cola (KO)Source: MAHATHIR MOHD YASIN / Shutterstock.comCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) includes a dividend that has not been reduced since 1963. The dividend pays 2.77% so the income it provides is relatively modest by comparison.KO stock doesn’t suffer from any of those risks mentioned in relation to REIT investing. Rather, it’s very liquid, and with a leverage ratio of 1.45, it’s not leveraged to a high degree.Coca-Cola is also a great defensive stock that performs particularly well in down markets and recessions. In fact, it has appreciated in price in 2022. That makes it very rare, one. And two provides compelling evidence that Coca-Cola is a great stock that investors of all experience levels will appreciate.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

InvestorPlace,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/heres-how-to-tell-what-the-market-may-do-next-1031995246,Here’s How to Tell What the Market May Do Next,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe S&P 500 is struggling – but that’s not surprising.It fell two weeks ago after the Federal Reserve signaled it would be more aggressive with its monetary policy in 2023. Now, the index is consolidating in bear-market territory below 3,854.90.The good news is the S&P 500 has found support at 3,800. The question now is whether that support level will hold.The answer may depend on the 10-year Treasury yield (TNX)…Pocket the Losses of Strangers’ Bad InvestmentsLittle-known system uses investor mistakes to give YOU the chance to pocket much as an extra $30,000 annually in instant CASH income…Go here now.The TNX-SPX RelationshipWall Street has been focusing on the TNX all year because rising rates tend to exert bearish pressure on growth stocks.They do so by pressuring traders to discount the value of companies’ future earnings. When traders can get a higher return from a “risk-free” investment, like a U.S. Treasury, they reduce the amount they are willing to pay for a riskier investment, like a growth stock.The S&P 500 is driven by large-cap growth stocks – like Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). When traders start reevaluating how much they are willing to pay for these stocks based on their future earnings potential, the S&P 500 suffers.You can see a direct inverse correlation between the value of the TNX and the value of the S&P 500 (SPX) this year (see below figures).When the TNX moves higher, the SPX moves lower.Here’s how the relationship has played out since June…Mid-JuneThe TNX climbed to a new high of 3.5%The SPX dropped into bear-market territory and finally found support at ~3,650Late SeptemberThe TNX climbed to 4% for the first time since 2010The SPX dropped to a new low at 3,600Mid-OctoberThe TNX jumped to a higher high of 4.3% for the first time since the Financial Crisis in 2008The SPX fell to a lower low at 3,500Early NovemberThe TNX established a lower high at 4.2%The SPX established a higher low at 3,700Now (Late December)The TNX has climbed back up to 3.8% after falling to 3.4%The SPX has dropped back down to 3,800 after challenging long-term down-trending resistance at 4,100As you can see, when the TNX forms higher highs, the SPX forms lower lows. The opposite is also true. When the TNX forms lower highs, the SPX forms higher lows.The Bottom LineThe TNX has been forming lower highs since late October. This has led to the SPX forming higher lows, which has been a good thing for the index.However, the TNX is on the cusp of breaking through down-trending resistance at 3.9% and forming a higher high…If the TNX breaks through down-trending resistance, we don’t think the SPX will be able to break out of bear-market territory.If the TNX breaks above 4.0%, look for the SPX to drop toward 3,600 – or lower.We’ll keep you updated as things progress.Until then, Happy New Year!Sincerely,John and WadeThe post Here’s How to Tell What the Market May Do Next appeared first on InvestorPlace.",27d
